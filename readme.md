## Description
This site presents two handy tools for developers. The first is a generator of lorem ipsum text. The user can specify the number of paragraphs needed, from 1-9. The second is a random user 'fabricator.' The tool can generate from 1-99 random users, with options to add an address, birthday, and/or profile blurb.

## Details for teaching team
I forgot to mention this in my demo, but I am pleased with the responsive navbar. Pretty easy to do with Bootstrap
